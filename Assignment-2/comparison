Comparison between the Best-First Search and A* Algorithm:

Best-First Search and A* are both informed search algorithms, but they differ in how they evaluate nodes during exploration. 
Best-First Search is greedy in nature, as it selects the next node to expand based only on the heuristic value h(n), which 
estimates the distance to the goal. This makes it faster in some cases but not guaranteed to find the optimal path, since it
ignores the cost already incurred. On the other hand, A* uses the evaluation function f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is the 
actual cost from the start to the current node and h(n) is the estimated cost to the goal. This balance between actual cost and 
heuristic ensures that A* is both complete and optimal, provided the heuristic is admissible. In summary, Best-First Search 
prioritizes speed over accuracy, while A* ensures the shortest or best solution, though it may require more time and memory.
